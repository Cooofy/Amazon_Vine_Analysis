### Overview of the analysis of the Vine program

The purpose of the analysis is to determine whether or not the Amazon Vine program was successful. Specifically if the Vine participants have significantly different reviews then their unpaid counterparts and if there was any bias in their reviews.

### Results

In the Amazon toys dataset, there were 1266 Vine reviews compared with 62,208 non-Vine reviews. Vine reviews contained 432 5-star reviews. Non-vine reviews contained 29,982 5-star reviews. This means the percentage of 5-star reviews is 34.12% for Vine reviews and 48.34% for non-Vine reviews.

### Summary

The results of the analysis indicate an lack of evidence for positivity bias since the percentage of 5-star reviews from Vine reviews are less than that of the general population. An additonal analysis that could provide more evidence is a NLP sentiment analysis of the review_headline and review_body columns. The average sentiment of a Vine review could be compared to a non-Vine review. Another analysis would be to look at 1-star reviews to determine if being paid (Vine review) deter one from writing a negative review.
